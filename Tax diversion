    Hypothetical function for identifying potential loopholes and inconsistencies in a tax system.

    Parameters:
        tax_code (str): String containing the tax code or regulations.
        tax_data (pandas DataFrame): DataFrame containing tax-related data (e.g., income, deductions, taxes paid).

    Returns:
        pandas DataFrame: DataFrame containing identified potential loopholes and inconsistencies.

    # 1. Text Analysis
    #   - Extract relevant text from the tax code using regular expressions or other text processing techniques.
    #   - Identify keywords, phrases, or patterns that might indicate potential loopholes or inconsistencies.

    # 2. Data Analysis
    #   - Analyze tax data to identify patterns or anomalies that might suggest loopholes or inconsistencies.
    #   - Compare tax data with the tax code to identify potential discrepancies or misinterpretations.

    #   - Combine the results from text analysis and data analysis into a single DataFrame.
    #   - Assign a severity level (e.g., low, medium, high) to each identified issue.
