    # 1. Offshore Account Creation
    #   - Identify a suitable offshore jurisdiction based on taxpayer's needs and risk tolerance.
    #   - Connect to an online offshore bank or service provider (simulated here using a hypothetical API).
    #   - Create an offshore account for the taxpayer using the provided information.
    #   - Deposit initial funds into the offshore account from the taxpayer's existing accounts.

    # Example API call for offshore account creation (simulated):
    offshore_bank_api_url = "https://example-offshore-bank.com/api/create-account"

    # 2. Financial Flow Optimization
    #   - Analyze financial data to identify potential investment opportunities in low-tax jurisdictions.
    #   - Utilize offshore account to invest in these opportunities, potentially reducing tax liabilities.
    #   - Monitor and manage investments to optimize returns and minimize risks.

    # Example investment analysis (simulated):
    investment_opportunities = []  # Populate with actual investment options
    for investment in investment_opportunities:
        print(f"Evaluating investment opportunity: {investment}")
        # Analyze potential tax benefits, risks, and returns
        # Make investment decisions based on analysis

    # 3. Ongoing Management
    #   - Continuously monitor tax laws and regulations in relevant jurisdictions.
    #   - Adapt offshore account structures and investment strategies as needed to maintain tax efficiency.
    #   - Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
